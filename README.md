# **Tell The Time**
This simple yet effective clock tells you the current time and timezone you are in. 
The `Tell The Time` web application is useful to everyone and is a fair representation of my limited yet expanding knowledge in Javascript. The set up is minimal which allows for maximizing loading speeds and useability. 

## **Testing**

HTML and CSS testing was done through `W3C` validators.
JavaScipt testing was done via `JSHint`.

- [Main Page](index.html) has issues.

- [CSS stylesheet](assets/css/style.css) has no issues.

- [JavaScript](assets/javascript/script.js) has no issues.

Special thanks go to the developer's personal friend 'Lucky' in Austria who
helped test the clock's timezone function and confirmed it worked.

## **Features**

### JavaScipt
The script I created has 2 functions that organise and run the two main asspects of the page. The first function is for the working clock and the second is for the timezone the user is in. 

### HTML and CSS
Basic, simply to follow and effective. My goal was to create effective and clean code in the shortest possible code. This optimization is a skill I am learning and this project begins this operation. 

## **Bugs**
<ul>
<li>I fixed aspects of my script that were a struggle. I have labelled this in the commit history.</li>
<li>Different spelling errors and minor things were caught as the code was written</li>
</ul>

## **Deployment**
- I deployed my site on GitHub pages. I followed instructions from [Code Institue](https://codeinstitute.net/se/5-day-coding-challenge/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=CI+-+SWE+-+Search+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=14660337051&hsa_grp=134087657984&hsa_ad=546251838233&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-319867646331&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0UQv6qv0SwHT3sAGJ6uF8SdJR6nThPCUkVs_yMLPFdVaHSEq1RtzB8aAtAuEALw_wcB) and deployed my site.

## **Credits**

 # NTI Gymnasium (Gothenburg Sweden) 
 The amazing staff and students who I work with everyday at this I.T school 
 helped me select the clock idea as a great first JavaScript project. I credit the school for topic selection and support when I was frustrated.

# Code Institute
This project is a projection of the learning material learnt on Code Institute's learning platfom.
